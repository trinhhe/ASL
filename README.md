# Optimizations

## Ideas
- data structures for more sequential access
- loop unrolling and scalar replacement
- saving pointer derefferncing
- precompute message products
- log adds instead of multiplications
- read input data more efficiently
- vector instructions
- find a way to make algorithm more efficient

## Implementations

### Example
- File name
- What changed
- Reasoning, why / hypothesis 
- did it work?
