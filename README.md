#Optimizations

##Ideas
- data structures for more sequential access
- loop unrolling and scalar rplacement
- savein pointer derefferncing
- precompute message product
- log adds instead of multiplications
- read input data more efficiently
- vector instructions
- find a way to make algorithm more efficient

##Implementations

###Example
- File name
- What changed
- Reasoning, why/hypothesis 
- did it work?
